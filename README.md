I'm LlmDl, the third lead developer of Towny. I have been managing the Towny project since 2014 and the release of Minecraft 1.8. Prior to me there was the original creator: Shadeness (active 2010-2011,) and the second developer: ElgarL (active 2011-2014.)

I am helped out by the TownyAdvanced team: Articdive, FlagCourier, Warrior and a few other private members. Being open-source Towny has a large list of [Contributors](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/graphs/contributors) who have helped improve the code base over the years as well.

Towny is one of the oldest still-in-development plugins for Minecraft. Shadeness created Towny for the now-defunct server platform called hMod. Shadeness ported Towny to Bukkit and left the project shortly afterwards, returning later to add EnemyWar or as it became known: [FlagWar](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/FlagWar). Towny is now over 10 years old!

### Staying up to date
<p><img align=right src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879756/65964779-3a067200-e423-11e9-9928-938b976af2c2.gif" height="155">
    
Now that all Release builds and Development builds are being made available here on github's [Releases](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/releases) tab I am recommending that server admins "watch" Towny on github. Just click the watch button in the upper right and select "Custom > Releases".
    
Alternatively, if you [watch the resource](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/towny-advanced.72694/watch) on Spigot you will be notified on that website when a new Release version is out.

### Importing Towny for API use
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/TownyAdvanced/Towny.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#TownyAdvanced/Towny)

Developers who wish to use the Towny API in their plugins may read [the following instructions on adding Towny via a Maven pom.xml.](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/TownyAPI#getting-started-with-towny-and-your-ide)

___

### Building Towny
If you would like to build from a specific branch yourself, you can do so with either [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), depending on the age of the branch.

For building, open your terminal / command prompt and navigate to the Towny Directory (either extracted, or cloned).

- **Maven**

    - Run `mvn clean package` to generate the plugin in the `target` directory, within the Towny folder. 


- **Ant** (_Deprecated_)

    - For older branches using the Ant build system, the main command to use would be: `ant clean jar`. This command will _exit_ the Towny directory, creating a lib folder alongside it. A Towny.jar file will be generated and placed within there.
    - _Note: As Ant is being deprecated, older branches may eventually not be able to be built against without modification of the `build.xml` file. We leave no guarantee that the file repo providing the dependencies will stay up._
