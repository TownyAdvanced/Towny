	Added new config option save_on_load. It's defaulted to off (which is opposite to what it was before). It will no longer to a giant save on startup which assured that what's in memory = saved in file. This should speed up startup of particular large db.
	Files are deleted when the object is deleted. It will not delete existing files, so files deleted outside of towny's regular actions will remain.
	Added allow_resident_plots to enable/disable plot commands, essentially freezing the plot system.
	Fixed admin add command (you couldnt add if you werent a mayor/assistant of any town).

	  appended to signify a range limit on chat.
	  
	  -1 = no limits
	  0 = same world only
	  any positive value = limited range in the same world.
	  
	  eg. - /g,,,towny.chat.global,-1
	        or a local channel that covers 100 blocks range
	        /l,&f[local],&f,towny.chat.local,100
	        
	- Added a 'spleef' plot type (for future development).

	- If a player doesn't have the 'towny.chat.global' permission node, any open chat will pass through for any other plugins to handle.

v0.79.1.13:
	- Fix for me breaking op's wild override.
	- Fix Admin commands from the console.
v0.79.1.14:
	- Flag war mode now supports economy payments for specific events. Those being:
    	- Payment to server -  to place a warflag.
    	- Attacking flagbearer -  pays the defender who broke the flag during a successful defend.
    	- Pillage fund - from defending town during a succesfuly attack. A different amount can be set for the homeblock.
    	  (Using a negative amount for pillaging will instead cause the attacker to pay a 'rebuilding cost'.)
v0.79.1.15:
	- You can no longer stand in a non-pvp area and safely shoot players outside in pvp areas.
	- Prevent TnT being regenerated if destroyed in explosions.
	- Fix Wild perms so it will follow the world settings if no permissions are found.
v0.80.0.0:
	- Release for MC 1.2.4
v0.80.0.1:
	- Fix monster spawning to obey the 'Force Town Mobs' world setting.
	- Add tentative support for Citizens2 to prevent removing NPC created as monsters.
v0.80.0.2:
	- Change Newday code to use iterators instead of creating new arrays (reliability and performance).
v0.80.0.3:
	- Add checks to make sure nations/towns/residents still exist when taxing as it's run in an async thread.
	- Remove the UnclaimedZoneIgnoreId's test when we are using permissions. We should only check the enable/disable flags on the world if the player doesn't have the perms.
v0.80.0.4:
	- Fix Enderman protection block move to follow the world toggle and ignore all other settings.
v0.80.0.5:
	- Move all Combat test functions to their own class. All now available via 'CombatUtil' (for other plugin devs).
v0.80.0.6:
	- Lets have another go at stopping these nations hanging on after they should be removed.

	- Fix cached Wild perms to use the world settings rather than global.
	- More javadocs.
	- Added UID's to the TownyObject for later implementation.
v0.80.0.7:
	- Added a new economy handler with support for...
	  - Register
	  - Vault (will require a build newer than 1.2.15-b172)
	  - Native iConomy 5.01
v0.80.0.8:
	- Moved all player modes under the resident object.
	  Modes can now be toggled using the command '/res toggle [mode]', as well as the already existing '/res set mode [mode]'.
	  An example would be '/res toggle map townclaim'. This would change the state for both of these modes to the opposite of what they were (on/off).
	  Issuing a command of '/res toggle' will clear all modes and set the defaults.
	- Added a new mode '/res toggle plotborder'.
	  This will puff smoke along the plot boundary when you enter a plot to show it's edges. Ideal for marking out plots.
v0.80.0.9:
	- Fix perms for...
	  towny.wild.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	  towny.claimed.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	- Update the TownBlock data when a plot is taken/given back to the town so it will correctly follow the towns permissions once again.
	- Save the town data to preserve the 'for sale' status when a townblock is put up, or taken off sale.
	- Players will now receive a warning message if their town or nation is due for deletion at the next new day tax period.
v0.80.0.10:
	- Move player login code to run in a seperate thread, and configure data retrieval and saving to be syncronized.
	- Rework Towny Regen to 'hopefully' prevent the incorrect world height being set.
	- Outposts can no longer be claimed in worlds which are set as unclaimable.
v0.80.0.11:
	- Rework all PvP and PvM code to properly prevent damage where approriate.
	- Added Villagers to be protected the same as animals when in a town.
	- Added two new Admin commands...
	  '/townyadmin town [name] delete'
	  '/townyadmin nation [name] delete'
	- Fix resident purge so it correctly filters up when updating towns/nations.
	- Better optimize damange prevention
v0.80.0.12:
	- Synchronize backup/delete to prevent lockups.
v0.80.0.13:
	- Simplify Wild and claimed permission nodes to reduce confusion and make the permission tests faster.

	- Fix permission overrides for Towny Ally and outsiders.
v0.80.0.17:

v0.80.1.1:

	- Fix sign removal upon a town deletion.
v0.80.1.3:
	- Fixed integration with Citizens2 for their API changes.

v0.80.1.7:
	- Fix the backup so it will only backup files it can actually read instead of throwing an error.
	- Fix town animal protection so no one can kill the animals in a plot unless they have perms to break grass in that plot.
	- Fix lava/water bucket hack/exploits.
	- Add finer control over block permissions. You can now allow the use of specific block types via permissions.
	  eg.
	    Granting '- towny.wild.build.35' allows a player to place wool blocks in the wilderness.
	    Now you can grant '- towny.wild.destroy.35:1' allowing them to only break brown wool.
	    This adds support for custom block types used in mods such as IndustrialCraft, Redpower etc.
v0.80.1.8:
	- Fix '/plot set' so only the towns mayor or assistants can change town plot types (no outsider mayors).
	- Stop trying to reset a non-existant cache for the Console when using '/ta town <town> add'

	- Really fix the NPE when PEX/GM generates a System update event.

	- Fix for MySQL using tinyint to hold Booleans.
	    SQL datbase names changed for h2 and SQLite databases.
	    If you use this version you need to rename your current h2/sqlite database
	    in the data folder from 'towny' to 'towny.sqldb' or 'towny.h2db'
v0.80.1.11:
	- Added the missing code to handle '/resident toggle {pvp/fire/explosion/mob}'.
v0.80.1.12:
	- Allow your own potions to affect you, even if you have friendly fire turned off.
	- Simplify permission negation so you don't have to negate every data type of a block.

	- New commands
	  '/town rank add/remove <player> <rank>'
	  '/nation rank add/remove <player> <rank>'
	- Added Towny's own permission system (townyperms.yml).
	  This system pushes permissions directly to Bukkit and works along side all other perms plugins.
	  It allows you to define sets of permissions based upon a players status (nomad/resident/mayor/king).
	  You can also assign additional permissions based upon any assigned town/nation ranks (assistant/vip etc).
	  This system is not limited to Towny perms. You can assign any permissions for any plugins in it's groups.
	- Deprecated the following permission nodes (all have replacements)...

      - This is being done because Essentials' economy changes the safe "town-TownNameHere" account to an unsafe "town_TownNameHere" account.

      - We are now including a warning message at startup to let server admins know that Essentials Economy has been resetting town and nation accounts.

      - Giving these extra plots, allows them to claim their maxplot amount plus the extra plot amount.
    - Change contributing.md to match our java 8 status.
    - Fix switch and destroy permissions for minecarts.
    - REQUIRED CONFIG ADDITION:

      - There is no scenario now where the server doesn't have permissions (everyone at least has the built-in BukkitPermissions.)
      - Some admins were setting this config option to False trying to solve other issues related to permissions and it was becoming problematic.
    - Cut off for PR6.

    - Towny will now pro-actively gather resident UUIDs for residents in a background task.
    - As long as the server is not already at 100% and the config setting below is true Towny will gather a UUID every 2 seconds.

    - It first asks the playercache on your server and if that fails it will ask the MojangAPI.
    - This will prepare your server for the day Towny switches to supporting UUIDs in the database.
    - Big thanks to creatorfromhell for his MojangAPI util.

  - Big New Feature: Town Bankruptcy.
    - When enabled in the config:
    - Towns which cannot pay their upkeep costs will go into a bankrupt state.
    - While bankrupt their bank will continue to pay upkeep (optional) and continue to pay nation tax (optional.)
    - Their bank balance will go into the negatives until they hit their DebtCap.
    - Debtcap is calculated by the cost of the town, townblock costs and outpost costs.
    - Debtcap can optionally be capped to another number in case a town has an very high natural debtcap.
    - Debtcap can optionally be overridden to a set number applied to all towns.
    - While bankrupt:
      - Towns cannot invite members.
      - Towns cannot set their town to open status.
      - Towns cannot claim more land.
      - Towns cannot have anything built in their land.
    - Towns can erase their debt by using the /t deposit command.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.enabled
    - default: false
    - If this setting is true, then if a town runs out of money (due to upkeep, nation tax etc.), it does not get deleted, but instead goes into a 'bankrupt state'.
    - While bankrupt, the town bank account is in debt, and the town cannot expand (e.g claim, recruit, or build).
    - The debt has a ceiling equal to the estimated value of the town (from new town and claims costs.)
    - The debt can be repaid using /t deposit x.
    - Once all debt is repaid, the town immediately returns to a normal state.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.debt_cap.maximum

    - When set to greater than 0.0, this will be used to determine every town's maximum debt overriding the above calculation if the calculation would be larger than the set maximum.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.debt_cap.override
    - default: 0.0
    - When set to greater than 0.0, this setting will override all other debt calculations and maximums, making all towns have the same debt cap.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.upkeep.delete_towns_that_reach_debt_cap
    - default: false
    - If a town has reached their debt cap and is unable to pay the upkeep with debt, will Towny delete them?
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.nation_tax.do_bankrupt_towns_pay_nation_tax
    - default: false
    - Will bankrupt towns pay their nation tax?
    - If false towns that are bankrupt will not pay any nation tax and will leave their nation.
    - If true the town will go into debt up until their debt cap is reached.
    - True is recommended when using a Siege War style war/conquering system, otherwise conquered towns will be able to leave the nation simply by not paying the nation tax.
    - False is recommended otherwise so that nations are not using abandoned towns to gather taxes.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.nation_tax.kick_towns_that_reach_debt_cap
    - default: false
    - If a town can no longer pay their nation tax with debt because they have reach their debtcap, are they kicked from the nation?

    - It is highly recommended you delete the switch_ids and item_use_ids lines in the config and let towny re-make them with the new defaults.
      - New itemuse list is 5 long, instead of 48.
      - New switch list is 30 long, instead of 128.
    - There are now groups of items that can be used in the itemuse/switch lists, which currently are:    
      - BOATS,MINECARTS,WOOD_DOORS,PRESSURE_PLATES,FENCE_GATES,TRAPDOORS,SHULKER_BOXES,BUTTONS 
    - Overall, the benefits are quite large. It is now much, much safer to give someone switch and item_use perms without having to worry about them breaking redstone builds, stripping logs and dyeing your signs.

      - Previous behaviour was to cancel the whole explosion if any block could not be blown up.

  - Add boat to possible switch use.
  - Move switch tests for vehicle entering to the Vehicle listener.

  - Add option for overclaimed towns to have their land stolen from them.
    - When enabled a Town which has claimed too much land, ie: TownBlocks 120/100, will be vulnerable to having some of their land stolen.
    - Stealing land is done by using /t takeoverclaim.
      - This command must be used at the edge of a town, which is adjacent to your town.
      - It comes with a customizable cost.
      - It does not allow an overclaimed Town to be cut into two separate parts.
      - Important: Towns can only have land stolen from them until they are no longer overclaimed!
      - Important: There is an option to prevent stealing land too close to a Town's HomeBlock!
      - Important: It is recommended to only enable this setting when outposts are disabled and min_adjacent_blocks is set to 2 or 3!
    - TownBlocks that can be stolen will have a [TakeoverClaim Available] added to their ChunkNotification.
    - Mayors will also see warnings:
      - on login while being overclaimed, 
      - when they approach their claim limit while claiming land, 
      - and when they lose a resident that would put them at risk of being overclaimed.
    - Closes #6564.
  - New Config Option: town.overclaiming.being_overclaimed_allows_other_towns_to_steal_land
    - Default: false
    - A feature that allows towns which have too many townblocks claimed (overclaimed) ie: 120/100 TownBlocks,
      to have their land stolen by other towns which are not overclaimed. Using this incentivises Towns to keep
      their residents from leaving, and will mean that mayors will be more careful about which land they choose
      to claim.
      Overclaiming does not allow a town to be split into two separate parts, requiring the Town that is stealing
      land to work from the outside inwards. 
      It is highly recommended to only use this on servers where outposts are disabled, and requiring
      a number of adjacent claims over 1 is enabled. Towns take land using /t takeoverclaim.
  - New Config Option: town.overclaiming.overclaiming_prevented_by_homeblock_radius
    - Default: true
    - While true, overclaiming is stopped by the min_distance_from_town_homeblock setting below.
    - This prevents a town from having townblocks stolen surrounding their homeblocks.
  - New Config Option: economy.takeoverclaim.price
    - Default: 100.0
    - The price to use /t takeoverclaim, when it has been enabled in the config 
      at town.being_overclaimed_allows_other_towns_to_steal_land
  - New Command: /town takeoverclaim
    - Used to a mayor to take over land from an overclaimed town, when allowed in the config.
    - Towns are considered overclaimed if their townblocks are more than they are allowed, ie: TownBlocks 120/100.
  - New Permission Node: towny.command.town.takeoverclaim
    - Child Node of towny.command.town.*

    - It is now possible for the towns within a nation to add more distance to the normal proximity, allowing nations to "go wide".
    - This means that towns can be outside of the nation's homeblock proximity as long as they are within a range of another of the nation's towns' homeblocks.
    - Additionally it is possible to make a cap on just how far nations' towns can boost that distance, with a new absolute cap on the proximity to the nation's homeblock.
    - This is controlled with the following new config entries:
  - Moved Config Option: global_town_settings.nation_requires_proximity -> global_nation_settings.proximity.nation_proximity_to_capital_city
    - Your config's setting value will be transferred to the new location.
    - Default: 0.0
    - The maximum number of townblocks a town's homeblock can be away from their nation capital's homeblock.
    - Automatically precludes towns from one world joining a nation in another world.
    - If the number is 0, towns will not require a proximity to a nation.
  - New Config Option: global_nation_settings.proximity.nation_proximity_to_other_nation_towns
    - Default: 0.0
    - The maximum number of townblocks a town's homeblock can be away from other towns's homeblocks in the nation.
    - This setting is only used when nation_proximity_to_capital_city is above 0.
    - When used, and a town is out of range of their capital city, the remaining towns in the nation will be parsed, if one of those
      towns' homeblocks is close enough to the town's homeblock, the town can remain in the nation.
    - Leave this setting at 0.0 in order to de-activate nations' towns granting further range for towns in the nation.
  - New Config Option: global_nation_settings.proximity.absolute_distance_from_capital
    - Default: 0.0
    - The maximum number of townblocks a town's homeblock can be away from their nation's capital's homeblock, when the town is
      being allowed to go further out from the capital because of the nation_proximity_to_other_nation_towns setting above.
    - This setting is what will stop a nation being able to go incredibly wide due to towns 'chaining' together.
    - This setting is only used when nation_proximity_to_capital_city is above 0.
    - Leave this setting at 0.0 in order to allow nations to chain towns together to go as wide as they like.

    - Default: false
    - If this is true, when a town becomes a ruin, every hour more and more of their plots will have their permissions turned to allow
      build, destroy, switch, itemuse to on. This will affect the newest claims first and progress until the first claims made are opened up
      right before the max_duration_hours have passed. When a town has more claims than max_duration_hours, multiple plots will be opened up
      each hour, ie: 500 claims and 72 max hours = 7 claims per hour.
    - If a Town has less claims than max_duration hours, those claims' permissions are opened up much more slowly with hours passing between
      plots opening up, ie: 36 claims and 72 max hours = 1 claim every 2 hours.
    - This system is meant to give players across many time zones the chance to loot a town when it falls into ruin.

0.100.3.7:
  - Account and Transaction changes.
    - A non-insignificant change was been made under the hood which could affect plugins using Towny's various Transaction Events.
    - The end result is that classes have been re-located to a new com.palmergames.bukkit.towny.object.economy.transaction pacakge.
    - This has resulted in a more robust system:
      - Transactions are better able to represent when money moves between your server's Towny objects.
      - Transaction events are now thrown much more often, allowing plugins to track transactions more accurately.
      - Accounts now backed by an EconomyHandler (think Resident, Town, Nation,) instead of a name, which should ease the transition to using UUIDs.
      - The TownyServerAccount is now a proper EconomyHandler, reducing jank in the code that is used in the Closed Economy feature.
    - If a plugin you use has broken, the author needs only change their imports section, switching to the re-located Transaction, TransactionType classes.
    - Plugins under the umbrella of the TownyAdvanced organization which are known to have broken include EventWar, FlagWar.

  - Add OfflinePlayer and UUID support to Economy backend, courtesy of Warrior with PR #7425.
    - Adds a "modern" economy implementation for Vault and Reserve back ends, while maintaining "legacy" implementations.
      - Already established servers will have their server set to legacy, while new installs will begin using the modern system right away.
    - The modern implementation makes use of Vault's OfflinePlayer methods, making Towny better suited to newer economy plugins that might not have fully implemented VaultAPI in their code.
    - Towny's Account class has been revamped with the Towny objects' UUIDs being used.
    - In cases where a server is using EssentialsX Economy, Towny will convert our non-player accounts' UUIDs into V2 UUIDs, allowing EssEco to know they do not belong to players.
  - Changed command: /ta depositall has changed to /ta eco depositall
  - Changed command: /ta resetbanks has changed to /ta eco resetbanks
  - New Command: /ta eco info [TownyObject] {name}
    - Used to see information about a resident, town, nation, or the Towny serveraccount's economy Account.
  - New Command: /ta eco convert modern
    - Will convert your Towny legacy accounts into modern accounts in your Economy plugin.
  - New Command: /ta eco convert {economyplugin}
    - Will convert your Towny economy accounts from your existing economy plugin, into the given economy plugin.
  - New Permission Node: towny.command.townyadmin.eco.*
    - A child node of towny.command.townyadmin.*, no changes required in your permission plugin.
    - Child Nodes:
      - towny.command.townyadmin.eco.depositall
      - towny.command.townyadmin.eco.resetbanks
      - towny.command.townyadmin.eco.info
      - towny.command.townyadmin.eco.convert
  - New Config Option: economy.advanced.modern
    - Default: true (on existing installs this will default to false)
    - When enabled, Towny will use UUIDs when communicating with your economy plugin.
    - Most users will never have to touch this, but for existing servers this option will automatically be set to false.
    - If this option is disabled and you wish to avoid losing data, use the `/townyadmin eco convert modern` command to convert.
  - New Config Option: economy.advanced.npc_uuid_version
    - Default: -1
    - The UUID version to use for non-player accounts. This is used so that economy plugins can more easily differentiate between player and NPC accounts.
    - The default is -1, which disables modifying npc uuids.

    - Adds the ability to assign a permission node to a mode, and when present, will require the player to have the permission node to toggle a node.
    - This permission node is not required if the mode is part of a player's default modes set via the permission plugin.
    - Additionally, the ability to clear a residents modes via command now requires a permission node.
    - All together this makes it possible for admins to set modes that players cannot remove.
    - Modes can have types, allowing for modes to be exclusive of each other, ie: you can no longer have townclaim and townunclaim modes active at the same time.
  - API: Added ResidentModesInitializeEvent with which plugins can add Resident Modes.
  - New Permission Nodes:
    - No changes required in the townyperms.yml.

    - The towns.ranks and nations.ranks sections support requiring their town or nation to have a minimum town_level or nation_level.

      - towny.town_level_requirement.4
    - Adding this to a town rank will require the Town to have a town_level of 4 or more to be able to assign that rank to their residents.
    - If the town lost population the residents with a rank beyond their town's town_level will have that rank removed from them.
    - When their town regains enough population, that rank will automatically be re-assigned to the resident.
    - When a town rank does not contain this node it will have no town_level requirement.
    - Likewise, nation ranks support an optional nation_level requirement, Ex:
      - towny.nation_level_requirement.4
    - When added to a nation rank this rank will only be granted when a nation is of level 4 or greater.

0.102.0.4:
  - UUID Database Update!
    - READ CAREFULLY, THIS UPDATE HAS CHANGES THAT CANNOT BE REVERSED EASILY.
    - Since Minecraft added UUIDs to players there has always been the idea of changing Towny over to using UUIDs as the main key in our database,
      but due to database instability this was not something that was considered a smart change. Database stability was majorly improved years ago
      however and starting in 2022 and 2023 I (LlmDl,) had pull requests on deck exploring/planning what a UUID-based database would look like for
      Towny. In the middle-to-late 2025 Warrior decided to revive the UUID database concept, breaking things into bite-sized pull requests that
      made the concept easier to review and merge. Those pull requests are as follows:
      - Load UUIDs for residents, towns & nations early, courtesy of Warrior with PR #7945.
      - Replace references to names with UUIDs in the database, courtesy of Warrior with PR #7962.
      - Clean up town/nation/resident renaming logic, courtesy of Warrior with PR #7963.
      - Use UUIDs for town/nation/resident file names in flatfile, courtesy of Warrior with PR #8023.
      Thanks to Warrior's efforts the UUID database has become a reality!
    - What this means for Towny server admins:
      - The database no longer saves using resident, town and nation names. Instead you will see UUID-named .txt files in the resident, town and
        nation folders, and UUIDs in the lists of friends, enemies and allies.
      - Once you updated to this version your database will be converted and there is no going back. Towny will create backups of your pre-UUID
        database if you have backups enabled in the Towny config.yml and you are using Towny in flatfile!
      - If your Towny database is stored in MYSQL you need to make your own backup! Towny doesn't back up MYSQL databases!
    - Benefits:
      - Your Towny database just got more error-proof.
      - Renaming of residents, towns, nations should no longer be prone to edge-case scenarios that could cause issues.
      - Server hosts which don't allow some unicode characters in the server file system's filenames will no longer fail to save/load towns and
        nations with special (usually accented,) characters.
      - If you change hosts and your future-host does not allow the above unicode characters to be used in the filesystem, your server will not
        immediately fail to load!
      - The main issue with Towny databases over the last few years was typically towns/nations being named with characters that server hosting
        would not allow in the filesystem, this database update will make this issue non-existant, which is why the benefits of this update
        outweigh the cons.
    - Cons:
      - The database's residents/towns/nations are no longer saved with their names. This makes editing your database manually trickier.
        - To help this out the residents' files will now contain their town's last-known name, the towns' files will contain their nation's and
          mayor's last-known name. All residents, towns and nations files will contain their last-known name in their files.
    - Ultimately, the benefits have outweighed the cons, stability has been good for Towny databases for 5+ years, and it is time to make this
      change in order to reduce the complexity of the codebase and to improve how Towny runs on varied server hosts.
