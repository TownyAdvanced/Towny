	Added new config option save_on_load. It's defaulted to off (which is opposite to what it was before). It will no longer to a giant save on startup which assured that what's in memory = saved in file. This should speed up startup of particular large db.
	Files are deleted when the object is deleted. It will not delete existing files, so files deleted outside of towny's regular actions will remain.
	Added allow_resident_plots to enable/disable plot commands, essentially freezing the plot system.
	Fixed admin add command (you couldnt add if you werent a mayor/assistant of any town).

	  appended to signify a range limit on chat.
	  
	  -1 = no limits
	  0 = same world only
	  any positive value = limited range in the same world.
	  
	  eg. - /g,,,towny.chat.global,-1
	        or a local channel that covers 100 blocks range
	        /l,&f[local],&f,towny.chat.local,100
	        
	- Added a 'spleef' plot type (for future development).

	- If a player doesn't have the 'towny.chat.global' permission node, any open chat will pass through for any other plugins to handle.

v0.79.1.13:
	- Fix for me breaking op's wild override.
	- Fix Admin commands from the console.
v0.79.1.14:
	- Flag war mode now supports economy payments for specific events. Those being:
    	- Payment to server -  to place a warflag.
    	- Attacking flagbearer -  pays the defender who broke the flag during a successful defend.
    	- Pillage fund - from defending town during a succesfuly attack. A different amount can be set for the homeblock.
    	  (Using a negative amount for pillaging will instead cause the attacker to pay a 'rebuilding cost'.)
v0.79.1.15:
	- You can no longer stand in a non-pvp area and safely shoot players outside in pvp areas.
	- Prevent TnT being regenerated if destroyed in explosions.
	- Fix Wild perms so it will follow the world settings if no permissions are found.
v0.80.0.0:
	- Release for MC 1.2.4
v0.80.0.1:
	- Fix monster spawning to obey the 'Force Town Mobs' world setting.
	- Add tentative support for Citizens2 to prevent removing NPC created as monsters.
v0.80.0.2:
	- Change Newday code to use iterators instead of creating new arrays (reliability and performance).
v0.80.0.3:
	- Add checks to make sure nations/towns/residents still exist when taxing as it's run in an async thread.
	- Remove the UnclaimedZoneIgnoreId's test when we are using permissions. We should only check the enable/disable flags on the world if the player doesn't have the perms.
v0.80.0.4:
	- Fix Enderman protection block move to follow the world toggle and ignore all other settings.
v0.80.0.5:
	- Move all Combat test functions to their own class. All now available via 'CombatUtil' (for other plugin devs).
v0.80.0.6:
	- Lets have another go at stopping these nations hanging on after they should be removed.

	- Fix cached Wild perms to use the world settings rather than global.
	- More javadocs.
	- Added UID's to the TownyObject for later implementation.
v0.80.0.7:
	- Added a new economy handler with support for...
	  - Register
	  - Vault (will require a build newer than 1.2.15-b172)
	  - Native iConomy 5.01
v0.80.0.8:
	- Moved all player modes under the resident object.
	  Modes can now be toggled using the command '/res toggle [mode]', as well as the already existing '/res set mode [mode]'.
	  An example would be '/res toggle map townclaim'. This would change the state for both of these modes to the opposite of what they were (on/off).
	  Issuing a command of '/res toggle' will clear all modes and set the defaults.
	- Added a new mode '/res toggle plotborder'.
	  This will puff smoke along the plot boundary when you enter a plot to show it's edges. Ideal for marking out plots.
v0.80.0.9:
	- Fix perms for...
	  towny.wild.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	  towny.claimed.build/destroy/switch/item_use
	- Update the TownBlock data when a plot is taken/given back to the town so it will correctly follow the towns permissions once again.
	- Save the town data to preserve the 'for sale' status when a townblock is put up, or taken off sale.
	- Players will now receive a warning message if their town or nation is due for deletion at the next new day tax period.
v0.80.0.10:
	- Move player login code to run in a seperate thread, and configure data retrieval and saving to be syncronized.
	- Rework Towny Regen to 'hopefully' prevent the incorrect world height being set.
	- Outposts can no longer be claimed in worlds which are set as unclaimable.
v0.80.0.11:
	- Rework all PvP and PvM code to properly prevent damage where approriate.
	- Added Villagers to be protected the same as animals when in a town.
	- Added two new Admin commands...
	  '/townyadmin town [name] delete'
	  '/townyadmin nation [name] delete'
	- Fix resident purge so it correctly filters up when updating towns/nations.
	- Better optimize damange prevention
v0.80.0.12:
	- Synchronize backup/delete to prevent lockups.
v0.80.0.13:
	- Simplify Wild and claimed permission nodes to reduce confusion and make the permission tests faster.

	- Fix permission overrides for Towny Ally and outsiders.
v0.80.0.17:

v0.80.1.1:

	- Fix sign removal upon a town deletion.
v0.80.1.3:
	- Fixed integration with Citizens2 for their API changes.

v0.80.1.7:
	- Fix the backup so it will only backup files it can actually read instead of throwing an error.
	- Fix town animal protection so no one can kill the animals in a plot unless they have perms to break grass in that plot.
	- Fix lava/water bucket hack/exploits.
	- Add finer control over block permissions. You can now allow the use of specific block types via permissions.
	  eg.
	    Granting '- towny.wild.build.35' allows a player to place wool blocks in the wilderness.
	    Now you can grant '- towny.wild.destroy.35:1' allowing them to only break brown wool.
	    This adds support for custom block types used in mods such as IndustrialCraft, Redpower etc.
v0.80.1.8:
	- Fix '/plot set' so only the towns mayor or assistants can change town plot types (no outsider mayors).
	- Stop trying to reset a non-existant cache for the Console when using '/ta town <town> add'

	- Really fix the NPE when PEX/GM generates a System update event.

	- Fix for MySQL using tinyint to hold Booleans.
	    SQL datbase names changed for h2 and SQLite databases.
	    If you use this version you need to rename your current h2/sqlite database
	    in the data folder from 'towny' to 'towny.sqldb' or 'towny.h2db'
v0.80.1.11:
	- Added the missing code to handle '/resident toggle {pvp/fire/explosion/mob}'.
v0.80.1.12:
	- Allow your own potions to affect you, even if you have friendly fire turned off.
	- Simplify permission negation so you don't have to negate every data type of a block.

	- New commands
	  '/town rank add/remove <player> <rank>'
	  '/nation rank add/remove <player> <rank>'
	- Added Towny's own permission system (townyperms.yml).
	  This system pushes permissions directly to Bukkit and works along side all other perms plugins.
	  It allows you to define sets of permissions based upon a players status (nomad/resident/mayor/king).
	  You can also assign additional permissions based upon any assigned town/nation ranks (assistant/vip etc).
	  This system is not limited to Towny perms. You can assign any permissions for any plugins in it's groups.
	- Deprecated the following permission nodes (all have replacements)...

      - This is being done because Essentials' economy changes the safe "town-TownNameHere" account to an unsafe "town_TownNameHere" account.

      - We are now including a warning message at startup to let server admins know that Essentials Economy has been resetting town and nation accounts.

      - Giving these extra plots, allows them to claim their maxplot amount plus the extra plot amount.
    - Change contributing.md to match our java 8 status.
    - Fix switch and destroy permissions for minecarts.
    - REQUIRED CONFIG ADDITION:

      - There is no scenario now where the server doesn't have permissions (everyone at least has the built-in BukkitPermissions.)
      - Some admins were setting this config option to False trying to solve other issues related to permissions and it was becoming problematic.
    - Cut off for PR6.

    - Towny will now pro-actively gather resident UUIDs for residents in a background task.
    - As long as the server is not already at 100% and the config setting below is true Towny will gather a UUID every 2 seconds.

    - It first asks the playercache on your server and if that fails it will ask the MojangAPI.
    - This will prepare your server for the day Towny switches to supporting UUIDs in the database.
    - Big thanks to creatorfromhell for his MojangAPI util.

  - Big New Feature: Town Bankruptcy.
    - When enabled in the config:
    - Towns which cannot pay their upkeep costs will go into a bankrupt state.
    - While bankrupt their bank will continue to pay upkeep (optional) and continue to pay nation tax (optional.)
    - Their bank balance will go into the negatives until they hit their DebtCap.
    - Debtcap is calculated by the cost of the town, townblock costs and outpost costs.
    - Debtcap can optionally be capped to another number in case a town has an very high natural debtcap.
    - Debtcap can optionally be overridden to a set number applied to all towns.
    - While bankrupt:
      - Towns cannot invite members.
      - Towns cannot set their town to open status.
      - Towns cannot claim more land.
      - Towns cannot have anything built in their land.
    - Towns can erase their debt by using the /t deposit command.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.enabled
    - default: false
    - If this setting is true, then if a town runs out of money (due to upkeep, nation tax etc.), it does not get deleted, but instead goes into a 'bankrupt state'.
    - While bankrupt, the town bank account is in debt, and the town cannot expand (e.g claim, recruit, or build).
    - The debt has a ceiling equal to the estimated value of the town (from new town and claims costs.)
    - The debt can be repaid using /t deposit x.
    - Once all debt is repaid, the town immediately returns to a normal state.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.debt_cap.maximum

    - When set to greater than 0.0, this will be used to determine every town's maximum debt overriding the above calculation if the calculation would be larger than the set maximum.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.debt_cap.override
    - default: 0.0
    - When set to greater than 0.0, this setting will override all other debt calculations and maximums, making all towns have the same debt cap.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.upkeep.delete_towns_that_reach_debt_cap
    - default: false
    - If a town has reached their debt cap and is unable to pay the upkeep with debt, will Towny delete them?
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.nation_tax.do_bankrupt_towns_pay_nation_tax
    - default: false
    - Will bankrupt towns pay their nation tax?
    - If false towns that are bankrupt will not pay any nation tax and will leave their nation.
    - If true the town will go into debt up until their debt cap is reached.
    - True is recommended when using a Siege War style war/conquering system, otherwise conquered towns will be able to leave the nation simply by not paying the nation tax.
    - False is recommended otherwise so that nations are not using abandoned towns to gather taxes.
  - New Config Option: economy.bankruptcy.nation_tax.kick_towns_that_reach_debt_cap
    - default: false
    - If a town can no longer pay their nation tax with debt because they have reach their debtcap, are they kicked from the nation?

    - It is highly recommended you delete the switch_ids and item_use_ids lines in the config and let towny re-make them with the new defaults.
      - New itemuse list is 5 long, instead of 48.
      - New switch list is 30 long, instead of 128.
    - There are now groups of items that can be used in the itemuse/switch lists, which currently are:    
      - BOATS,MINECARTS,WOOD_DOORS,PRESSURE_PLATES,FENCE_GATES,TRAPDOORS,SHULKER_BOXES,BUTTONS 
    - Overall, the benefits are quite large. It is now much, much safer to give someone switch and item_use perms without having to worry about them breaking redstone builds, stripping logs and dyeing your signs.

      - Previous behaviour was to cancel the whole explosion if any block could not be blown up.

  - Add boat to possible switch use.
  - Move switch tests for vehicle entering to the Vehicle listener.
