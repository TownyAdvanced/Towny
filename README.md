I took over from ElgarL after MC 1.8 was released. Past developers have included: Shadeness, FuzzieWuzzie, ElgarL. 
With help coming from other developers from time to time including dumptruckman, ole8pie, SwearWord, gravypod, andrewyunt and more.

Towny is one of the oldest still-in-development plugins for Minecraft. It was created by Shadeness for the now-defunct server platform called hMod.

It is the second-oldest land protection plugin to become popular for Minecraft, having been beaten by WorldGuard by just a couple months, Towny is now over 10 years old! Go check out some of the [features](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki#features) Towny has and see why it's still popular for yourself.

### Staying up to date
<p><img align=right src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/879756/65964779-3a067200-e423-11e9-9928-938b976af2c2.gif" height="155">
    
Now that all Release builds and Development builds are being made available here on github's [Releases](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/releases) tab I am recommending that server admins "watch" Towny on github. Just click the watch button in the upper right and select "Releases Only".
    
Alternatively, if you [watch the resource](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/towny-advanced.72694/watch) on Spigot you will be notified on that website when a new build is out.

### Connect/Support
The documentation found on the [Towny Wiki](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki) is updated every time a Release version of Towny is put out. If you are using a development build it is expected that you have read the [changelog](https://git.io/fjbS3) for any important changes since the previous Release build.

### Importing Towny for API use
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/TownyAdvanced/Towny.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#TownyAdvanced/Towny)

Developers who wish to use the Towny API in their plugins may read [the following instructions on adding Towny via a maven pom.xml.](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny/wiki/TownyAPI#getting-started-with-towny-and-your-ide)

___

### Building Towny
If you would like to build from a specific branch yourself, you can do so with either [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), depending on the age of the branch.

For building, open your terminal / command prompt and navigate to the Towny Directory (either extracted, or cloned).

- **Maven**

    - Run `mvn clean package` to generate the plugin in the `target` directory, within the Towny folder. 


- **Ant** (_Deprecated_)

    - For older branches using the Ant build system, the main command to use would be: `ant clean jar`. This command will _exit_ the Towny directory, creating a lib folder alongside it. A Towny.jar file will be generated and placed within there.
    - _Note: As Ant is being deprecated, older branches may eventually not be able to be built against without modification of the `build.xml` file. We leave no guarantee that the file repo providing the dependencies will stay up._
